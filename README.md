Dittobytes compiles your C-code to truly Position Independent Code (PIC) for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and both AMD64 and ARM64. It features a [metamorphic engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_code) that ensures each compilation produces unique, functional shellcode. It does *not* rely on the classic decrypt stubs often seen in e.g. polymorphic compilations, and additionally it does *not* require reflective loaders such as Donut or sRDI as it can compile your C-code directly to PIC. A subsequent advantage is that the output size of the shellcode is extremely small (almost no overhead), and remains very simple.

<p align=center><sup>Illustration 1: Example metamorphications by Dittobytes (left and right are functionally equivalent).</sup></p>

<p>
    Dittobytes uses a custom LLVM build with two transpilers. Any compilation of your code using Dittobytes is done with this LLVM build. The first transpiler uses a modern <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.html">LLVM Function Pass</a> (on intermediate level) to inline constant variables otherwise located in e.g. <code>.rodata</code> segments (this aids the development of Position Independent Code). The second one is the machine transpiler that uses a legacy <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html#the-machinefunctionpass-class">LLVM MachineFunction Pass</a> to perform the metamorphic transformations (e.g. instruction substitutions), introducing randomness in the assembly code during compilation. Check the <a href="#-metamorphications">roadmap</a> for all implemented (and yet to implement) metamorphic transformations.
</p>

The pre-shippped minimal C-code file (`./code/beacon.c`) can cross-compile to all supported platforms (Windows, Linux & MacOS), architectures (AMD64 & ARM64) and formats (PIC, BOF, EXE). Additionally, Dittobytes ships with loaders (for each platform and architecture) that can be used for testing purposes.

<p>The build environment itself works best (and is tested) on Linux (AMD64 & ARM64). Use Docker for an easy setup.</p>

    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Clone this repository using Git:<br><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes.git</code></pre></li>
        <li>Manually <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/.github/laughing.gif">review</a> the code so you know what you're compiling and running.</li>

    <summary>Configuring the build environment in a <b>Docker</b> container<br><sup>Difficulty: <strong>easy</strong></summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The easiest way to use Dittobytes is via Docker. For this, you need to build a Docker image using the provided <code>Dockerfile</code>.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Build the Docker image:<br><pre><code>docker buildx build -t dittobytes .</code></pre></li>
            <li>Building the image will take around 2.5 hours as LLVM needs to be built from source.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Configuring the build environment in a <b>Windows Subsystem for Linux</b> container instead<br><sup>Difficulty: <strong>intermediate</strong></summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If you are on Windows, a more performant option to build the build tools is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). However, in contrast to Docker, the installation of the build tools is a manual process.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>First of all, install a Debian WSL container:<br><pre><code>wsl --install -d Debian</code></pre></li>
            <li>Then start & enter the container:<br><pre><code>wsl -d Debian</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Custom versions of Clang and LLVM are eventually used to cross-compile your code, the loaders and the transpilers. Performing this compilation in WSL requires you to configure your WSL the same way as the Docker container is configured. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/validation.yml">GitHub Workflow</a> for reference. Follow the exact same steps as in one of those files. For now, there is no further documentation on setting up the environment in WSL.

        Custom versions of Clang and LLVM are used to cross-compile your code, the loaders and the transpilers. If you want to perform this compilation on your host machine, configure your host the same way as the Docker container is configured. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/validation.yml">GitHub Workflow</a> for reference.

### Developing

<details>
    <summary>The basics</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        You can modify <code>./code/beacon.c</code> however you like. Just keep the following in mind:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The first function in your code must be named <code>EntryFunction</code>.</li>
            <li><code>EntryFunction</code> must literally (in order) be the first function in your code.</li>
            <li>You cannot use global variables (PIC limitation).</li>
            <li>You cannot use any data from other segments (PIC limitation).</li>
            <li>You must resolve any API function you want to use by yourself (PIC limitation).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following example may give you some guidance. It simulates global variables by using a context struct that you would need to pass to any function you call. It initializes a string by using a <code>char[]</code> array. It calls another function by defining its definition first (as the other function needs to be defined before you can call it, but it cannot be the first function in your code).
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/tijme/dittobytes/blob/master/code/examples/example-basics/example-basics.c">Example 'The Basics' (<code>example-basics.c</code>)</a>
    </p>
    <hr>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>A hello world</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A hello world requires printing to the console, thus requiring an OS API call to e.g. <code>puts</code>. This is OS specific. For example, for Windows it would require loading <code>KERNEL32.dll</code>, ultimately resolving <code>LoadLibraryA</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code>. With these two functions resolved, you can then load any function address, such as the address of <code>puts</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example would become quite large, thus for now I'd like to forward you to example file below. It is a Position Independent Code (PIC) for Windows AMD64 & ARM64 which pops a calculator as example.

### Compiling

<details>
    <summary>Compile your code</summary>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>If using Docker, run the Dittobytes container (or use an equivalent command for your build environment):<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
        <li>Compile your code (for all platforms, architectures & formats):<br><pre><code>make</code></pre></li>
        <li>You can also create specific builds: <code>make beacon-[platform]-[arch]-[format]</code>.
            <ul>
                <li>Options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platforms: <code>win</code>,<code>lin</code>,<code>mac</code>.</li>
                        <li>Architectures: <code>amd64</code>,<code>arm64</code>.</li>
                        <li>Formats: <code>exe</code>,<code>raw</code>,<code>bof</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>make beacon-win-amd64-bof</code> (compile your code to Windows AMD64 BOF/COFF).</li>
                        <li><code>make beacon-mac-arm64-raw</code> (compile your code to MacOS ARM64 raw shellcode).</li>
                        <li><code>make beacon-lin-all-raw</code> (compile your shellcode to raw shellcode for Linux and any architecture).</li>
                        <li><code>make beacon-all-all-raw</code> (compile your shellcode to raw shellcode for any platform and architecture).</li>
                        <li><code>make beacon-all-all-all</code> (compile your shellcode to any format any platform and any architecture).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

</details>

### Outputs

<details>
    <summary>Position Independent Code (<code>.raw</code>)</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>Dittobytes was originally designed to output Truly Position Independent Code (PIC). Simply put, PIC consists of the executable assembly instructions from the <code>.text</code> segment of an executable binary, without any reference to other segments or absolute memory addresses.</p>
    <p>Dittobytes generates <code>.raw</code> files for Windows, Linux and MacOS (and both AMD64 and ARM64).</p>
    <hr>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Beacon Object File (<code>.obj</code>)</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>In the process of creating Position Independent Code, Dittobytes creates an <code>.obj</code> file (COFF/ELF format). This file is later used to extract the <code>.text</code> segment (<code>.raw</code>) from, or create the executable format (<code>.exe</code>) with. However, the <code>.obj</code> file itself can be used as Cobalt Strike (or any other C&C framework) Beacon Object File (BOF) as well.</p>
    <p>Dittobytes generates <code>.obj</code> files for Windows, Linux and MacOS (and both AMD64 and ARM64).</p>
    <hr>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Executable/Clickable (<code>.exe</code>)</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>Dittobytes uses the generated Position Independent Code (PIC) in the <code>.obj</code> file to eventually generate an executable/clickable file format (<code>.exe</code>). This means that all executables generated by Dittobytes solely contain Position Independent Code (PIC). For example, constants are inlined instead of stored in the <code>.rodata</code> segment.</p>
    <p>Dittobytes generates <code>.exe</code> files for Windows, Linux and MacOS (and both AMD64 and ARM64).</p>
    <hr>
</details>

### Testing

<details>
    <summary>Running your shellcode</summary>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Run and test your shellcode using the pre-shipped shellcode loader:
            <br>
            <pre><code>./build/loader-[os]-[arch].[ext] ./build/beacon-[os]-[arch].raw</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Running feature tests</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Dittobytes comes pre-shipped with feature tests. A feature test is similar to a unit test, but tests from a large feature perspective, instead of a specific code unit perspective. Currently, you can only run feature tests for shellcodes that are compiled for the platform you are running the tests on. For example, in the Docker container only the Linux shellcode would be tested & verified.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
            <li>Build the tests:<br><pre><code>make test-suite-build</code></pre></li>
            <li>Run the tests:<br><pre><code>make test-suite-test</code></pre></li>
        </ul>

    <summary>Using C++ instead of C for your code</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        You can easily utilize functionality of C++ by renaming your code file from <code>./code/beacon.c</code> to <code>./code/beacon.cpp</code>. Just make sure to prepend the <code>EntryFunction</code> in the file with <code>extern "C"</code>. Also ensure that the <code>SOURCE_PATH</code> option in the <code>makefile</code> points to the new filename. Do note that you <b>cannot</b> use functionality from external libraries such as <code>libstdc++</code> or <code>libc++</code>. This means you <b>cannot</b> make use of e.g. <code>std::string</code> ⚠️.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Compiling C++ code in Dittobytes works exactly the same as compiling regular C-code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
        <li>Then compile your code:<br><pre><code>make</code></pre></li>

    <summary>Compiling a Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File (BOF)</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        To compile a Beacon Object File (BOF) for Cobalt Strike or any other Command & Control framework, copy <code>./code/examples/example-bof/example-bof.c</code> to <code>./code/beacon.c</code>. Then adjust the source code to your needs.

    </p>
    <p>Remember to solely compile to the <code>BOF/COFF</code> format using the <code>make</code> command (see below example) ⚠️.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
        <li>Then compile your code:<br><pre><code>make beacon-win-amd64-bof</code></pre></li>

    <summary>Modification & compilation of the pre-shipped loaders</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        You can modify the pre-shipped loaders by editing the code in <code>./ditto/loaders/[platform]/src/main.c</code>, after which you can compile them using the following commands in the root of the Dittobytes project:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
            <li>Compile the loaders:<br><pre><code>make ditto-loaders</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <summary>Modification & compilation of the pre-shipped transpilers</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        You can modify the pre-shipped transpiler(s) by editing the code in <code>./ditto/transpilers/[type]/src/[type].cpp</code>, after which you can compile them using the following commands in the root of the Dittobytes project:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
            <li>Compile the transpilers:<br><pre><code>make ditto-transpilers</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        Dittobytes ships with two transpilers. The first one is the intermediate transpiler that uses a modern <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.html">LLVM Function Pass</a> to inline constant variables otherwise located in <code>.rodata</code> segments. The second one is the machine transpiler that uses a legacy <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html#the-machinefunctionpass-class">LLVM MachineFunction Pass</a> to perform the metamorphism.

    <summary>Compiling & running one specific feature test</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The test-suite commands in the makefile usually compile and test all feature tests (cross-os and cross-architecture). If you want to test just one specific feature test, or if you want to to test build artifacts for a specific os or architecture, use the commands below. You can adjust the <code>TEST_*</code> arguments to your needs.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If using Docker, run a Dittobytes container:<br><pre><code>docker run --rm -v ".:/tmp/workdir" -it dittobytes</code></pre></li>
            <li>Build the test(s):<br><pre><code>make TEST_OS=win TEST_ARCH=arm64 TEST_SOURCE_PATH=./ditto/tests/all/all/3_metamorphication_010_transform_nullifications.c TEST_METAMORPHICATION=transform_nullifications test-suite-build</code></pre></li>
            <li>Run the test(s):<br><pre><code>make TEST_OS=win TEST_ARCH=arm64 TEST_SOURCE_PATH=./ditto/tests/all/all/3_metamorphication_010_transform_nullifications.c TEST_METAMORPHICATION=transform_nullifications test-suite-test</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        The above example would build the feature test <code>3_metamorphication_010_transform_nullifications.c</code> for Windows ARM64. This may result in many build artifacts (<code>[amount of feature tests] × [amount of os's] × [amount of arch's] × [amount of metamorphications]</code>), in this case 1 (<code>1 × 1 × 1 × 1</code>). The second command verifies the build artifacts based on the <code>@verify</code> statements in the feature test source code file(s).

There is no specific planning, so this might be more of a to-do or progress list.

There are currently two known limitation in the use of Dittobytes.

* LLVM cannot inline compile `float`'s and `double`'s, causing them to end up in the `.rodata` segment. As a result, these types do not work when compiled with Dittobytes.
* C++ exceptions are not yet supported as they generate exception tables outside the `.text` segment.
